# DemographiCast

## Overview
DemographiCast is a machine learning project designed to predict election outcomes based on historical electoral data. Using Random Forest alogrithms, thsi project analyzes data from previous U.S presidential elections to forcast voting behaviors and election results.

## Project Goals
* To develop a predictive model that assists campaign strategists, policymakers, and the public in understanding potential election outcomes.
* To enhance strategic electoral planning through data-driven insights, improving decison-making processes in political campaigns.
* To provide a tool for academic and education purposes, illustrating the application of machine learning in political science.

## Features
* Utilizes historical electoral which employs a Random Forest model to analyze patterns and predict future voting behaviors.
* Evaluated on accuracy, precision, and recall metrics to ensure robustness and reliability.

## Usage 
This project is intended for researchers, data scientists, and political analysts interested in the intersection of machine learning and electoral politics. It can serve as a basis for further research or be adapted to other types of electoral data and predictive modeling.
