    "Based on historical voting data from 2016 and 2020, our predictive model utilizes shifts in vote shares to forecast election outcomes. While the model shows promising accuracy in back-testing, predicting the 2024 election accurately hinges on several factors: continued voting patterns, demographic shifts, and political climate changes leading up to the election. As such, while our predictions provide a data-driven forecast based on past trends, they should be interpreted with caution, considering potential future variables that could influence voter behavior."
